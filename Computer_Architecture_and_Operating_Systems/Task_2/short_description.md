Implement an assembly function, callable from C, with the signature:

```c
void sum(int64_t *x, size_t n);
```

The function takes two arguments: a pointer `x` to a non-empty array of 64-bit integers and its size `n`. The function performs the following operation:

1. Initializes a variable `y` to 0.
2. Iterates through the array, calculating a sum where each element is multiplied by a power of 2, determined by the formula `2 ** floor(64 * i * i / n)`.
3. The result, `y`, is then stored back in the array `x`, in little-endian order.

The function should perform the calculations in-place, without using any additional memory, and assumes `x` is valid and `n` is positive and less than \(2^{29}\).
