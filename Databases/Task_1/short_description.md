The attached file is a CSV containing a dataset of publications from employees at the Institute of Computer Science from 2017 to 2020. The task is to create a table with appropriate columns, insert the data into it, and then use a query to list all publications from 2020 where the average number of points per author is 100 or more, sorted by the number of authors.

You should submit a single text file containing:

- One CREATE TABLE statement (to create the table)
- A series of INSERT statements (to insert the data)
- One SELECT statement (the query)

The file must execute correctly with the command

SQL> @filename.sql

in an Oracle database (or similarly in PostgreSQL).
