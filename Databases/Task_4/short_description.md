The Erdős number is defined as the smallest number assigned to scientists in the following way: Erdős himself gets 0, his co-authors get 1, co-authors of his co-authors get 2, and so on. Although Erdős is not present in our publication data, a variant of the Erdős number can be defined starting from any scientist.

The task is to write a query that calculates the "Michał Pilipczuk number" (for the scientist with ID 'Pilipczuk Mi') for each employee. If the number is undefined, return NULL.

Note: The query might take a long time to compute with the full dataset. Test it on a smaller sample and don’t worry about the execution time with the complete data.
