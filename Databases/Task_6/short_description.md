Create a conceptual data model for the following situation:

At a scientific conference, papers from various fields of computer science (e.g., databases, operating systems, algorithms, logic) will be presented. Each paper is presented by one of its authors during a presentation. Presentations are grouped into sessions, each led by one of the conference participants. Not all participants will give a presentation or be an author of a paper. Some participants may be authors of multiple papers and can present multiple papers (but not in the same session). The session chair cannot be an author of any paper presented during that session.

Ensure that all the described assumptions are verifiable based on the stored data. Whenever possible, these assumptions should be included in the model.
